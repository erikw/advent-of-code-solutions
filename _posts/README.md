# Blog Posts

This directory contains blog-style markdown posts about Advent of Code solutions and experiences.

All markdown headers in these files follow proper English title case rules:
- First and last words are always capitalized
- Major words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are capitalized
- Minor words (articles, conjunctions, short prepositions) are lowercase unless they're the first or last word

To fix title casing in all markdown files in this directory, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/fix_title_casing.py
```
